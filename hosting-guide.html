                <p class="intro-text">Congratulations on creating your webpage with the Futurelab AI Page Generator! Now that you have your <code>index.html</code> (or your main HTML file) and your <code>styles.css</code> (or your CSS file), the next step is to get them online so everyone can see your creation. This guide will walk you through the most common and recommended ways to host your new website, complete with examples and step-by-step instructions.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Your Files</h3>
                <p>Typically, the AI generator provides you with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An <strong>HTML file</strong> (e.g., <code>generated-page.html</code> or <code>index.html</code>): This file contains the structure and content of your page. Think of it as the skeleton of your website.</li>
                    <li>A <strong>CSS file</strong> (e.g., <code>generated-styles.css</code> or <code>lab.css</code>): This file holds all the styling rules that define the appearance of your page – colors, fonts, layout, etc. It's the "skin" and "clothes" of your website.</li>
                    <li>Possibly an <strong>Images folder</strong> (e.g., <code>/assets/images/</code>): If your page includes images, they will likely be in a separate folder.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you downloaded an "Edited HTML" version, the CSS might be embedded directly within the HTML file inside <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags. In this case, you'll primarily be uploading a single HTML file. If your CSS is separate, ensure your HTML file correctly links to it. The link should look something like this in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of your HTML file:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
                </div>
                <p>Or, if your CSS file is in a subfolder (e.g., a folder named "css"):</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"&gt;
                </div>
                <p><strong>Crucial:</strong> These paths must be relative and correct for the hosting environment. This means the HTML file needs to know where to find the CSS file once they are both uploaded to the server.</p>

                <h3>Option 1: Static Hosting Services (Recommended for Simplicity & Performance)</h3>
                <p>Static hosting services are specifically designed to serve files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. They are generally very fast, secure, easy to use, and many offer generous free tiers perfect for personal sites, portfolios, or initial project launches.</p>

                <h4>A. Netlify</h4>
                <p>Netlify is a powerhouse for static site hosting. It's incredibly user-friendly with features like drag-and-drop deployment, seamless Git integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), automatic HTTPS, custom domains, and continuous deployment (your site updates automatically when you push code changes to your connected Git repository).</p>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with Netlify:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Create a free account at <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">netlify.com <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. You can usually sign up with your GitHub, GitLab, or email.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Your Files:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure your main HTML file is named <code>index.html</code>. This is the default file Netlify (and most servers) will look for.</li>
                            <li>Organize your files into a single folder on your computer. For example:
                                <div class="code-block">
                                my-website/<br>
                                ├── index.html<br>
                                ├── styles.css<br>
                                └── images/ (folder with your images, if any)
                                </div>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deploy Your Site:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Method 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest for beginners)</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Log in to your Netlify dashboard.</li>
                                    <li>Scroll down to the "Sites" section. You'll see an area that says "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site output folder here."</li>
                                    <li>Drag your entire <code>my-website</code> folder (from the example above) into this area.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Method 2: Connect to Git (Recommended for ongoing projects)</strong>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Push your <code>my-website</code> folder to a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.</li>
                                    <li>In Netlify, click "Add new site" (or "New site from Git").</li>
                                    <li>Choose "Import an existing project" and connect to your Git provider.</li>
                                    <li>Authorize Netlify to access your repositories.</li>
                                    <li>Select the repository you just created.</li>
                                    <li>Configure deployment settings:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Branch to deploy:</strong> Usually <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Build command:</strong> Leave this blank for simple HTML/CSS sites.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Publish directory:</strong> If your <code>index.html</code> is in the root of your repository, leave this as is or set to the folder name if you pushed the folder itself (e.g., <code>my-website</code>). If you only pushed the *contents* of `my-website` to the root, this can be left blank or set to `/`. Netlify is usually good at detecting this.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Click "Deploy site."</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Go Live:</strong> Netlify will instantly build and deploy your site. It will provide you with a unique URL (like <code>your-awesome-site.netlify.app</code>). You can find this on your site's dashboard in Netlify.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Domain (Optional):</strong> In your site's settings on Netlify, you can go to "Domain management" to add your own custom domain (e.g., <code>www.yourdomain.com</code>). Netlify provides instructions on how to configure your domain's DNS records.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>B. Vercel</h4>
                <p>Vercel, from the creators of Next.js, is another top-tier platform for deploying static sites and serverless functions. It's renowned for its global edge network, ensuring fast load times worldwide, and its excellent developer experience, especially if you plan to use JavaScript frameworks later.</p>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with Vercel:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Register for a free "Hobby" account at <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">vercel.com <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>, often by connecting your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Your Files:</strong> Same as for Netlify: have an <code>index.html</code> and your assets in a well-organized folder. Push this folder to a Git repository.</li>
                    <li><strong>Import Project:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." > "Project".</li>
                            <li>Connect your Git account if you haven't already.</li>
                            <li>Select the repository containing your site from the list. Click "Import."</li>
                            <li>Vercel will typically auto-detect that it's a static site. You usually don't need to change any build settings for plain HTML/CSS. The "Root Directory" should point to where your <code>index.html</code> is located within the repository.</li>
                            <li>Click "Deploy."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Access Your Site:</strong> Vercel will deploy your site and give you a live URL (e.g., <code>your-project.vercel.app</code>). You can find this and manage your project from the Vercel dashboard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Domain (Optional):</strong> In your project's settings on Vercel, go to the "Domains" tab to add and configure a custom domain.</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>C. GitHub Pages</h4>
                <p>If your website code is already hosted on GitHub (or you're comfortable using Git and GitHub), GitHub Pages is a fantastic and free way to publish it directly from your repository.</p>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with GitHub Pages:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Repository:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one.</li>
                            <li>Ensure your main HTML file is named <code>index.html</code>.</li>
                            <li>Upload your files (<code>index.html</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, images folder, etc.) to this repository. The <code>index.html</code> should ideally be in the root of the repository or in a folder named <code>/docs</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Enable GitHub Pages:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Navigate to your repository on GitHub.</li>
                            <li>Click the "Settings" tab for your repository.</li>
                            <li>In the left sidebar, click on "Pages."</li>
                            <li>Under "Build and deployment":
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For "Source," select "Deploy from a branch."</li>
                                    <li>For "Branch," choose the branch where your code is (commonly <code>main</code> or <code>master</code>). Then select the folder: <code>/(root)</code> if <code>index.html</code> is in the root, or <code>/docs</code> if it's in a <code>docs</code> folder.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Click "Save."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Site Published:</strong> GitHub will start a deployment process (you might see an "Actions" tab showing the progress). After a few moments, your site will be live at <code>http://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/</code>. The exact URL will be displayed in the GitHub Pages settings once it's live.</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Domain (Optional):</strong> You can add a custom domain in the GitHub Pages settings by entering your domain name and following the instructions to update your DNS records.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>D. Cloudflare Pages</h4>
                <p>Cloudflare Pages offers robust free static site hosting, leveraging Cloudflare's extensive global network for speed and security. It integrates smoothly with Git workflows and provides features like unlimited bandwidth and preview deployments.</p>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with Cloudflare Pages:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Sign Up:</strong> Create a free Cloudflare account at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">cloudflare.com <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare Your Files & Git Repository:</strong> As with Netlify and Vercel, have your site files (<code>index.html</code>, CSS, images) in a Git repository (GitHub or GitLab).</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a Pages Project:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard.</li>
                            <li>In the sidebar, navigate to "Workers & Pages."</li>
                            <li>Click "Create application," then select the "Pages" tab.</li>
                            <li>Choose "Connect to Git."</li>
                            <li>Select your Git provider, authorize Cloudflare, and choose the repository containing your website.</li>
                            <li>In the "Set up builds and deployments" section:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Production branch:</strong> Select your main branch (e.g., <code>main</code>).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Build command:</strong> For plain HTML/CSS, you can often leave this blank or select "None" from framework presets.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Build output directory:</strong> If your <code>index.html</code> is in the root, this can usually be left as is or set to `/`. If it's in a subfolder, specify that folder.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Click "Save and Deploy."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Cloudflare Pages will build and deploy your site. You'll get a unique <code>*.pages.dev</code> subdomain (e.g., <code>your-project.pages.dev</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Domain (Optional):</strong> You can add custom domains through the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for your project. If your domain's DNS is already managed by Cloudflare, this is particularly seamless.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Option 2: Traditional Web Hosting (Using cPanel or FTP)</h3>
                <p>If you have an existing web hosting plan with a provider like Bluehost, GoDaddy, SiteGround, etc., you can typically upload your files using their control panel (often cPanel) or via an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client. This method gives you more server-side control but can be slightly more complex than static hosting services.</p>

                <h4>A. Using cPanel File Manager</h4>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with cPanel File Manager:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Log In:</strong> Access your hosting account's cPanel. Your hosting provider will give you the URL and login details.</li>
                    <li><strong>File Manager:</strong> Look for an icon or link named "File Manager" and open it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Navigate to Web Root:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The main directory for your website's files is usually <code>public_html</code>. Double-click to open it.</li>
                            <li>If you are hosting on an addon domain or subdomain, navigate to its specific document root folder (e.g., <code>public_html/yoursubdomain</code> or <code>youraddondomain.com</code>). Your hosting provider's documentation will specify this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Upload Files:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inside the correct directory, look for an "Upload" button or link in the File Manager's toolbar.</li>
                            <li>You can usually upload files one by one or upload a ZIP archive of your website folder and then extract it on the server.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Single files:</strong> Upload your <code>index.html</code>, your CSS file(s), and any individual image files. If you have an <code>images</code> folder, you'll need to create that folder first within File Manager (using "New Folder") and then navigate into it to upload the images.</li>
                                    <li><strong>ZIP file (Recommended for multiple files/folders):</strong>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>On your computer, create a ZIP file containing your entire website folder (e.g., <code>my-website.zip</code> which includes <code>index.html</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, <code>images/</code> etc.).</li>
                                            <li>Upload this single ZIP file.</li>
                                            <li>Once uploaded, select the ZIP file in File Manager and look for an "Extract" button or option (often available by right-clicking the file). Extract the contents into the current directory (e.g., <code>public_html</code>).</li>
                                            <li>Ensure the files are extracted into the correct location and not into an extra subfolder (e.g., you want <code>public_html/index.html</code>, not <code>public_html/my-website/index.html</code> unless <code>my-website</code> is intended to be part of the URL).</li>
                                        </ol>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Check Your Site:</strong> Your website should now be accessible via your domain name (e.g., <code>www.yourdomain.com</code>).</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>B. Using an FTP Client (e.g., FileZilla)</h4>
                <p>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard way to transfer files between your computer and a web server. FileZilla is a popular, free FTP client.</p>
                <h5>Step-by-Step with FileZilla:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Get FTP Credentials:</strong> From your hosting provider, you'll need:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>FTP Host/Server Address:</strong> e.g., <code>ftp.yourdomain.com</code> or an IP address.</li>
                            <li><strong>FTP Username:</strong> Your FTP-specific username.</li>
                            <li><strong>FTP Password:</strong> Your FTP password.</li>
                            <li><strong>Port:</strong> Usually 21 for FTP, or 22 for SFTP (Secure FTP, recommended if available).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Install FTP Client:</strong> Download and install FileZilla from <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external-link">filezilla-project.org <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect to Server:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open FileZilla.</li>
                            <li>Use the "Quickconnect" bar at the top (enter Host, Username, Password, Port) or go to "File" > "Site Manager" to save your site details for future use (recommended).</li>
                            <li>Click "Connect" or "Quickconnect."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Files:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>FileZilla has a two-pane view. The <strong>left panel (Local site)</strong> shows files on your computer. Navigate to your website folder (e.g., <code>my-website</code>).</li>
                            <li>The <strong>right panel (Remote site)</strong> shows files on your web server. Navigate to your web root directory (e.g., <code>public_html</code> or similar).</li>
                            <li>Select all your website files and folders (<code>index.html</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, <code>images/</code> folder, etc.) in the left local panel.</li>
                            <li>Drag them from the local panel (left) to the remote panel (right) into the <code>public_html</code> directory.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the transfer queue at the bottom of FileZilla to ensure all files upload successfully.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Once the upload is complete, visit your domain in a web browser to see your live site.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Key Things to Double-Check After Uploading:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>File Naming (<code>index.html</code>):</strong> Your main HTML page <em>must</em> be named <code>index.html</code> (all lowercase). Web servers are configured to look for this file by default when someone visits your site's root URL (e.g., <code>www.yourdomain.com</code>) or a directory URL (e.g., <code>www.yourdomain.com/about/</code>).</li>
                    <li><strong>File Paths & Case Sensitivity:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure all paths in your HTML (for CSS, JavaScript, images) are correct relative to the <code>index.html</code> file's location on the server.
                                <div class="code-block">
                                &lt;!-- Correct: CSS file in the same directory --&gt;<br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;<br><br>
                                &lt;!-- Correct: CSS file in a 'css' subfolder --&gt;<br>
                                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"&gt;<br><br>
                                &lt;!-- Correct: Image in an 'images' subfolder --&gt;<br>
                                &lt;img src="images/logo.png" alt="My Logo"&gt;
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Important:</strong> Most web servers (especially Linux-based, which is common) are <strong>case-sensitive</strong> with file and folder names. If your image is <code>Logo.png</code> but your HTML links to <code>logo.png</code>, it won't work. Ensure consistency between your filenames and your HTML references. Windows is not case-sensitive, so this often trips up beginners.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Custom Domain Configuration:</strong> All these hosting options allow you to use a custom domain name (e.g., <code>www.yourbrand.com</code>). You'll typically need to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Purchase a domain from a registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains).</li>
                            <li>Configure your domain's DNS (Domain Name System) records at your registrar to point to your hosting provider. Your hosting provider will give you specific instructions (e.g., update A records, CNAME records, or nameservers). DNS changes can take some time to propagate (minutes to 48 hours).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>HTTPS (SSL Certificates):</strong> Serving your site over HTTPS (<code>https://</code>) is crucial for security (encrypts data), visitor trust (shows a padlock in the browser), and SEO.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Static Hosts (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages):</strong> These usually provide free and automatic SSL certificates. It's often enabled by default.</li>
                            <li><strong>Traditional Hosting:</strong> Many cPanel hosts offer free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates. You might need to enable this through your cPanel (look for "SSL/TLS Status" or "Let's Encrypt SSL"). If not free, consider if the hosting is worth it, as SSL is a modern necessity.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Browser Cache:</strong> If you make changes and don't see them, or if things look broken, try clearing your browser's cache or doing a "hard refresh" (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Page Not Found (404 Error):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is your main HTML file named exactly <code>index.html</code> (all lowercase)?</li>
                            <li>Did you upload your files to the correct directory on the server (e.g., <code>public_html</code>)?</li>
                            <li>If using a custom domain, have the DNS changes fully propagated? (Can take time).</li>
                            <li>Check for typos in the URL you are trying to access.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Styles Not Loading (Page Looks Like Plain HTML):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the path to your CSS file correct in your <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the HTML? Check for typos and case sensitivity.</li>
                            <li>Did you upload the CSS file to the server? Is it in the correct folder relative to <code>index.html</code>?</li>
                            <li>Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12, then go to the "Console" or "Network" tab). Look for errors related to loading the CSS file (e.g., 404 Not Found). This will often show the incorrect path it's trying to load.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Images Not Displaying:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Similar to CSS: check the <code>src</code> path in your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags for correctness, typos, and case sensitivity.</li>
                            <li>Did you upload the image files? Are they in the correct folder on the server?</li>
                            <li>Check the browser's developer console for errors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mixed Content Warnings:</strong> If your site is HTTPS but you're linking to HTTP resources (e.g., an image from an <code>http://</code> URL), browsers might block it or show warnings. Ensure all external resources (images, scripts, fonts) are loaded via HTTPS.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Choosing the right hosting option depends on your technical comfort level and specific needs. For most users of the AI Page Generator, <strong>static hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages offer the best balance of ease of use, performance, and cost</strong> (often free for basic needs). They also simplify many technical aspects like SSL certificates and deployment workflows.</p>

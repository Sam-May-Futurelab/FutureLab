                    <p>Website builders promise the world: drag, drop, launch. But if you've ever used one, you know it's rarely that simple. As professional web designers, we've worked with businesses who started on Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, Carrd — and ran into real limitations that no one talks about until it's too late.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this post, we'll explore the truth about website builders, comparing them with custom-coded sites, and showing you what to consider before you commit to your platform. Whether you're a founder, marketer, or small business owner, this guide will help you make a smarter decision — one that won't leave you stuck six months from now.</p>

                        <h2>1. The Website Builder Pitch — And Why It's So Tempting</h2>
                        <p>Website builders like Wix, Webflow, Carrd, and Squarespace market themselves as fast, cheap, and code-free. And to be fair, they are incredibly easy to get started with. You pick a template, drag some blocks, add your logo, and boom — you're online.</p>
                        <p>The pitch: You don't need a developer. You don't need to learn HTML. Just sign up and build.</p>
                        <p>But fast and easy often comes at a cost — and we're not just talking money.</p>

                        <h2>2. Hidden Costs of Drag-and-Drop Builders</h2>
                        <p>Most people think website builders are cheap — and they are, at first. But many quickly realise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You'll need to upgrade to remove ads or use a custom domain</li>
                            <li>Essential features (like forms, SEO tools, analytics) are locked behind higher-tier plans</li>
                            <li>You're limited to the platform's ecosystem — and add-ons can get expensive</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You might start on a £12/month plan, but by the time you add what you need, you're closer to £40–60/month. Multiply that over a year, and it's often more than hiring someone to build a lean, custom site.</p>

                    <section id="templates-vs-branding" class="mt-4">
                        <h2>3. Templates vs Branding: Why Your Site Still Looks Like Everyone Else's</h2>
                        <p>One of the biggest limitations of website builders is their heavy reliance on pre-built templates. Sure, they look slick. But so do thousands of other websites using the exact same one.</p>
                        <p>Custom branding? Hard to pull off unless you know CSS.<br>
                        Unique layouts? You're working within the grid.</p>
                        <p>With custom code or pro help, you control every pixel. You get a site that actually looks and feels like your brand, not just another template with your logo slapped on.</p>

                    <section id="seo-limitations" class="mt-4">
                        <h2>4. SEO Limitations (That Hurt You Long-Term)</h2>
                        <p>Let's get real: SEO is not about just adding keywords. It's about structure, speed, semantic HTML, clean markup, crawlability — all the stuff builders often gloss over.</p>
                        <p>Many drag-and-drop platforms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't let you edit key meta tags fully</li>
                            <li>Produce bloated code that slows down your site</li>
                            <li>Offer limited access to things like alt tags, structured data, or sitemap control</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If Google can't understand your site clearly, or if it loads slowly, your rankings suffer. Custom-coded sites — or even lightweight HTML/CSS pages like those generated by <a href="../lab.html">Futurelab's AI tool</a> — give you cleaner, faster output.</p>

                    <section id="outgrow-platform" class="mt-4">
                        <h2>5. What Happens When You Outgrow the Platform?</h2>
                        <p>This is a big one. You start with a builder because you're testing an idea. But then you gain traction. You want custom features. Maybe an app. Maybe an integration.</p>
                        <p>Then you realise:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You can't export your content easily</li>
                            <li>You're locked into their CMS</li>
                            <li>You can't move your design elsewhere without rebuilding from scratch</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>That means time lost, SEO lost, momentum lost.</p>
                        <p>With custom code, your site is portable. You own your stack. You can evolve without being trapped.</p>

                    <section id="performance-matters" class="mt-4">
                        <h2>6. Performance Matters More Than You Think</h2>
                        <p>Users bounce fast. If your site takes more than 3 seconds to load, most visitors leave. Unfortunately, most website builders produce code that's bloated, messy, and dependent on multiple scripts loading at once.</p>
                        <p>This leads to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slower page speed scores</li>
                            <li>Lower conversions</li>
                            <li>Worse user experience</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Custom-coded sites, on the other hand, can be built to load in under a second. At Futurelab, we routinely deliver sub-1.5s load times — and you feel the difference immediately.</p>

                        <p>Modern websites should be accessible. That means readable by screen readers, navigable by keyboard, and usable for everyone. But many website builders:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't meet accessibility standards out of the box</li>
                            <li>Lack semantic markup for proper screen reader support</li>
                            <li>Offer poor contrast or hidden navigation when customising</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With a custom build, accessibility can be baked in — not slapped on.</p>

                        <p>"No code" is amazing until you need something that isn't in the UI. Then what?</p>
                        <p>Want to animate one block but not another? Need custom JS? Good luck.</p>
                        <p>Want to display different content to logged-in users? Usually not possible.</p>
                        <p>Want to build something outside the template grid? Better learn CSS.</p>
                        <p>This is the dirty secret: Most website builders are fine — until you want to do anything interesting. That's when their limits show.</p>

                        <p>Platforms like Wix and Carrd manage security for you — that's great. But it also means:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You don't control when backups happen</li>
                            <li>You can't restore a single file or revision</li>
                            <li>If the platform shuts down or changes pricing, you're at their mercy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With your own site (especially hosted static HTML/CSS), you can version-control your content, back it up manually or with Git, and move hosts freely.</p>

                        <p>We're not against website builders — in fact, they're perfect for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple one-page sites</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>If you need to get something up right now, tools like Carrd or even your <a href="../lab.html">AI-generated landing pages</a> are a smart, strategic choice. Just know their limits — and be ready to upgrade when you outgrow them.</p>

                        <p>Custom websites don't mean "expensive from day one." They mean scalable, optimised, fast, and unique. You don't have to go full dev-mode, either — at Futurelab, we often blend:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>AI-generated landing pages (from <a href="../lab.html">our tool</a>) for speed</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>That way, you get the speed of a builder with the control of custom code.</p>

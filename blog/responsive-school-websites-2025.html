                    <p class="intro">Your school's website isn't just a digital brochure - it's a living, breathing communication hub. It shapes first impressions, answers questions before they're asked, and plays a key role in parent engagement and Ofsted compliance.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2025, expectations for school websites are higher than ever. Whether it's a parent trying to check term dates on their phone or a new family comparing schools online, your website needs to deliver clarity, speed, and confidence.</p>
                    
                    <p>In this post, we'll unpack what makes a responsive school website great, show off real-world examples, and break down how Futurelab builds websites that make schools proud - and parents reassured.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What Makes a Great School Website in 2025?</h2>
                    <p>Let's set the bar high. A good school website today must check more than just the design box - it has to perform technically, function smoothly across devices, and make admin life easier behind the scenes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's what we prioritise in every school build:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Mobile-First Design</h3>
                    <p>More than 75% of users browse school websites on their phone. Yet many school sites still treat mobile as an afterthought - with cluttered layouts, tiny buttons, or broken navigation. A responsive site adapts perfectly across phones, tablets, and desktops. For parents on the go, this matters.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Accessibility & Inclusion</h3>
                    <p>UK schools serve a diverse community. That includes parents and pupils with visual impairments, language challenges, or neurodiversity. A strong website supports everyone - with features like high contrast text, alt tags, readable font sizes, and screen reader compatibility.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Ofsted-Friendly Structure</h3>
                    <p>Ofsted doesn't grade your site's design - but they do require specific information to be easily accessible. This includes policies, performance data, SEN info, and safeguarding documentation. A smart layout ensures these aren't buried behind confusing menus.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Fast Load Times</h3>
                    <p>Every second counts. A slow site frustrates users and pushes them away - especially on mobile networks. We aim for load times under 2 seconds, even on content-heavy pages. Google likes this, and so do parents.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Easy Content Management</h3>
                    <p>School staff shouldn't have to call a developer every time they need to update a lunch menu or upload a PDF. We build CMS-driven sites that are intuitive and fully editable by non-technical users.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What Parents Expect from a School Website</h2>
                    <p>Before we get to visual examples, it's worth pausing to ask: what are parents actually looking for when they land on your school site?</p>
                    
                    <p>From our experience, here's what they expect:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>A clear sense of your school's values and culture - do you feel friendly, inclusive, academic, creative?</li>
                        <li>Quick access to essentials: term dates, school hours, contact info, uniforms, clubs, curriculum.</li>
                        <li>A fast-loading experience with no confusing navigation.</li>
                        <li>Updated information - not a newsletter from two years ago still on the homepage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>A great school website builds trust. Parents want to feel that your school is organised, communicative, and modern - not playing catch-up online.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Real-World Examples of Excellent School Website Design</h2>
                    <p>Let's look at five standout websites we've either built or studied closely, highlighting what they do right.</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Meadowbrook Primary - Greater Manchester</h3>
                    <p>This project focused on warmth and clarity. We used large, friendly fonts, custom photography of real pupils (with parental consent), and a clean navigation structure with three clear user paths: "Parents," "Pupils," and "Staff."</p>
                    
                    <p>Notably, the homepage adapts beautifully on mobile. The weekly newsletter, calendar highlights, and lunch menus are all accessible without scrolling endlessly.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Emotional tone + mobile-first UX + quick access to key info.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Horizon Academy Trust - Yorkshire</h3>
                    <p>This multi-school trust needed a scalable, brand-consistent site system. We designed a modular framework where each school could maintain its own personality while keeping structure consistent - helping both users and administrators.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each sub-site loads quickly, shares a universal CMS, and includes a dashboard where staff can update their own content, documents, and alerts.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Scalability + brand cohesion + decentralised control.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. St. Catherine's RC School - Midlands</h3>
                    <p>This school came to us with a painfully slow WordPress site built in 2012. Load times were over 8 seconds. We rebuilt from scratch using lightweight code and image optimisation - and dropped their page load to 1.1 seconds across all pages.</p>
                    
                    <p>We also restructured the navigation, grouping key pages (policies, curriculum, contact) into a logical system that works for both desktop and mobile users.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Huge performance gains + simplified user flow.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Northern Inclusive College - Lancashire</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility was priority one for this post-16 provider. We integrated a high-contrast toggle, ARIA labels, keyboard-friendly tab navigation, and compliant downloadable resources.</p>
                    
                    <p>All PDFs were reviewed and replaced with HTML or screen-reader-friendly versions wherever possible - a big win for users and compliance alike.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Truly inclusive design + WCAG 2.1 compliance baked in.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Cedars Infant School - London</h3>
                    <p>We gave this vibrant little school a site that matched its personality - soft pastel colours, playful icons, and warm tone-of-voice throughout.</p>
                    
                    <p>But behind the scenes? A bulletproof CMS that lets the admin staff update pages with drag-and-drop simplicity. No training needed.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Joyful visual identity + staff empowerment via intuitive backend.</p>
                    
                    <h2>What Ofsted Expects on a School Website</h2>
                    <p>It's not enough for your site to look good - it must also meet regulatory expectations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's a short list of content Ofsted expects to be easily accessible:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact information for staff and governors</li>
                        <li>Admissions policy and process</li>
                        <li>Curriculum overview by key stage</li>
                        <li>SEN (Special Educational Needs) information</li>
                        <li>Latest Ofsted report</li>
                        <li>Behaviour, safeguarding, and equalities policies</li>
                        <li>Catch-up funding or Pupil Premium strategy</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>We often find schools have this content - but it's buried under outdated menus or broken links. Our audits always start with a compliance checklist to ensure you're inspection-ready.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Why Many School Websites Still Miss the Mark</h2>
                    <p>Even in 2025, it's common to find school websites that feel stuck in the early 2010s. Some common issues:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mobile menus that don't open (or even exist)</li>
                        <li>Newsletters uploaded as blurry scanned PDFs</li>
                        <li>Massive hero images that take 10 seconds to load</li>
                        <li>Confusing navigation with 40+ pages</li>
                        <li>"Contact us" forms that go nowhere</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These aren't minor quirks - they're barriers. They frustrate parents, weaken engagement, and create unnecessary admin work.</p>
                    
                    <p>We've even seen Ofsted reports reference "difficulty finding key information on the website" as a concern.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Our Process: How We Build High-Impact School Sites</h2>
                    <p>At Futurelab, we design and build school websites that look good - but more importantly, work beautifully.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's how:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Audit & Discovery</h3>
                    <p>We analyse your current site, understand your school's values, and identify the pain points for parents and staff.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Wireframing & UX Design</h3>
                    <p>We map out clean, intuitive site flows - with mobile in mind from the first sketch.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Custom Build</h3>
                    <p>No templates. No bloated themes. Just clean, modern code and lightweight CMS integration that runs fast and stays flexible.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Content Support</h3>
                    <p>Need help rewriting content or organising your policies? We assist with that too - keeping it clear, accessible, and parent-friendly.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Training & Handover</h3>
                    <p>You get control. We train your staff to use the backend with confidence. Updating pages, uploading forms, and editing menus will be easy.</p>
                    
                    <h3>6. Ongoing Support (Optional)</h3>
                    <p>From hosting to backups to future updates - we can stay on board if you want us to.</p>
                    
                    <h2>FAQs: Everything Schools Ask Us</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Do school websites really need to be mobile-optimised?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Over 75% of traffic comes from mobile. Parents expect a site that's quick, clickable, and readable on the go.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How much does a school website cost?</h3>
                    <p>Our primary school builds typically start at £1,800. Multi-academy trust solutions or advanced builds may range higher depending on complexity.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Can we update the site ourselves after launch?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Our CMS lets staff add events, swap photos, or update documents with zero coding knowledge. We offer hands-on training too.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Do your sites meet Ofsted and accessibility requirements?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. We build every site with Ofsted's checklist in mind and follow WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What if we already have a website but want to improve it?</h3>
                    <p>We offer full audits and can rebuild using your existing content - or migrate what's working into a cleaner, faster structure.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Ready to Bring Your School Website Up to Standard?</h2>
                    <p>A modern, responsive school website isn't a luxury - it's the new baseline. It builds trust with families, supports your staff, and ensures you're ready for every visitor, whether it's a new parent or an Ofsted inspector.</p>
                    
                    <p>If your current site is clunky, confusing, or just plain hard to manage - we'd love to help.</p>

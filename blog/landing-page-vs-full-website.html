            <p>Deciding between a landing page and a full website is one of the first and most important choices any business owner faces online. It’s not just a design decision; it impacts your budget, strategy, conversion rate, and long-term growth.</p>
            <p>At Futurelab, we’ve worked with everyone from solo founders to fast-growing brands. Some needed just a high-performing single page. Others were ready for full custom builds. In this guide, we’ll help you figure out exactly what you need with real use cases, pros and cons, and smart next steps.</p>

            <section id="what-is-a-landing-page" class="mt-4">
                <h2>1. What Is a Landing Page?</h2>
                <p>A landing page is a standalone web page designed with a single focused goal in mind, typically to convert visitors into leads or customers. Whether it's encouraging users to sign up for a newsletter, download a freebie, or pre-order a product, landing pages eliminate distractions and guide users toward one clear action. They're especially useful for product launches, ad campaigns, and MVP validation. Because landing pages are minimal and intentional, they're often the fastest way to get something live and start testing your idea.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="what-is-a-full-website" class="mt-4">
                <h2>2. What Is a Full Website?</h2>
                <p>In contrast, a full website comprises multiple pages, structured navigation, and broader objectives. It serves as a digital hub for your business, allowing visitors to explore different services, learn about your brand, read content, and make informed decisions. A full website might include a homepage, about page, blog, contact form, service listings, and more. This kind of structure supports long-term growth, builds authority, and creates multiple user journeys to meet different types of visitor intent.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="key-differences" class="mt-4">
                <h2>3. Key Differences Between a Landing Page and a Website</h2>
                <p>While both serve essential roles, landing pages and websites differ greatly in purpose, content scope, and technical requirements. Landing pages focus on a single objective and minimal content, often designed to convert traffic from a specific source like ads. Websites, meanwhile, offer richer information across multiple pages, catering to users who are exploring, comparing, or researching. Websites are better for SEO, content marketing, and showcasing complex offerings, while landing pages excel in simplicity and conversion.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="when-to-use-landing-page" class="mt-4">
                <h2>4. When a Landing Page Is the Right Choice</h2>
                <p>Landing pages shine in scenarios where speed, simplicity, and conversion are the top priorities. If you’re launching something new and want to test it quickly, a landing page can be live in minutes. It’s ideal when you’re promoting a single product, running paid ad campaigns, or collecting leads through a waitlist. For businesses with limited budgets or in the early stages of validation, this approach offers a smart way to get measurable results without heavy development.</p>
                <p>At Futurelab, our <a href="../lab.html">AI Landing Page Generator</a> is designed specifically for this. With just a few questions, it creates a custom page in minutes. No code, no hassle. You can preview, edit, and download clean HTML/CSS with a built-in hosting guide.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="when-to-use-full-website" class="mt-4">
                <h2>5. When a Full Website Makes More Sense</h2>
                <p>If your business has multiple services, long-term content plans, or needs to convey a more complete brand story, a full website is the way to go. It offers structured navigation, credibility through depth, and better support for organic search. Service-based businesses, consultancies, e-commerce brands, and growing startups benefit from websites that provide context, build trust, and support multiple user journeys.</p>
                <p>At Futurelab, we build full <a href="../web-design.html">custom websites</a> that balance performance with personality, SEO-ready, mobile-responsive, and aligned to your brand's goals. We also offer <a href="../ecommerce.html">e-commerce solutions</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="budget-timeline" class="mt-4">
                <h2>6. Budget & Timeline Considerations</h2>
                <p>Landing pages are fast and cost-effective. With tools like our <a href="../lab.html">AI generator</a> or platforms like Carrd and Webflow, you can launch something meaningful in a day or two, often for less than £250. Full websites, on the other hand, involve planning, copywriting, development, and sometimes integration with CMS platforms, expect a timeline of 2 to 8 weeks and a budget starting from £750 depending on complexity.</p>
                <p>If you’re short on time or budget but need an online presence now, start with a landing page. You can always scale into a full site later.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="seo-performance" class="mt-4">
                <h2>7. SEO & Performance Considerations</h2>
                <p>Landing pages are typically used with paid traffic, where speed and clarity matter more than keyword rankings. That said, a well-optimised landing page can still perform in organic search for specific long-tail terms. Full websites, by contrast, are built for SEO: multiple indexed pages, internal linking, blog content, and structured metadata all contribute to long-term discoverability.</p>
                <p>If organic growth is part of your strategy, a full website provides the flexibility and structure to make it happen. That said, don’t underestimate the power of a single, fast-loading page to deliver serious results especially in ad-driven funnels.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="mobile-ux-conversion" class="mt-4">
                <h2>8. Mobile, UX, and Conversion Flow</h2>
                <p>Mobile experience and UX are crucial, regardless of format. A landing page is typically optimised for a single scroll journey, with punchy content, minimal distractions, and one crystal-clear call-to-action. Websites must manage multiple entry points and user paths from a homepage, through service pages, contact forms, and blog posts.</p>
                <p>If your audience needs a smooth, distraction-free path to take action (e.g. sign up, pre-order, book a demo), a landing page is ideal. If they need to browse, compare, or explore, a website offers the structure they need.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="can-you-do-both" class="mt-4">
                <h2>9. Can You Do Both?</h2>
                <p>Absolutely. Many of our clients at Futurelab launch with a landing page to validate their product or service - often using our <a href="../lab.html">AI generator</a> - and later transition to a full site once they gain traction. Others maintain both: a central website and additional landing pages for specific campaigns, offers, or paid ads.</p>
                <p>We've even built hybrid setups where we integrate standalone pages into larger website ecosystems so you get the flexibility of rapid testing with the strength of long-term infrastructure.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="how-to-decide" class="mt-4">
                <h2>10. How to Decide (With a Simple Framework)</h2>
                <p>Start by asking yourself the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I need to drive search traffic or am I focusing on paid traffic?</li>
                    <li>Is this a single product/service or am I showcasing a portfolio?</li>
                    <li>Do I have multiple audiences or one specific segment?</li>
                    <li>Am I launching fast, or building for the long haul?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're in the early stages or launching something specific, a landing page is a quick win. If you're building a full digital presence and want to scale with SEO, then a full website is worth the investment.</p>
                <p>At Futurelab, we support both routes; our <a href="../lab.html">landing page generator</a> gets you live in minutes, while our <a href="../web-design.html">custom web design services</a> help you scale confidently.</p>

                        <h3>Can I use a landing page as my main site?</h3>
                        <p>Yes. If your business has one primary goal and you're running ads or validating a concept, a landing page can absolutely serve as your temporary online HQ.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Will I rank in Google with just a landing page?</h3>
                        <p>It's possible, but limited. A single page can rank for very specific keywords if optimised well, but a full website is far better for building organic traffic over time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I upgrade later?</h3>
                        <p>Definitely. Starting with a landing page is often the smartest strategy. Get traction, gather data, then build out a full website with confidence.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Yes. We offer "mini sites" which are lightweight multi-page websites (e.g., Home, Services, Contact) for founders who need more than a landing page but aren't ready for a large-scale build.</p>

                <p>A landing page offers speed, clarity, and focus, perfect for launching, validating, or promoting something specific. A full website provides the depth, flexibility, and SEO power to build your brand and support long-term growth. The right choice depends on your goals, timeline, and budget.</p>
